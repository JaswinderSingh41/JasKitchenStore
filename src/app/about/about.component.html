      <b>For more than 60 years, we’ve been making Connecticut families happy to come home.</b><br><br><br>

      <p><i>How we do that is only part of the story. Why we do it – the reason we’re so committed to quality, honesty,
          integrity and total client satisfaction – is rooted in our company’s history.

          <br>
          <br>

          The Kitchen Company was founded in 1953 when Jaswinder Singh wasn't born, a sales rep for Republic Steel and a
          veteran of both
          WWII and the Korean War, recognized the growing demands of the post-war housing market.

          <br>
          <br>

          Anonymous (father to current owners/designers) began selling premade kitchen cabinetry
          wholesale to builders from a warehouse on Old Broadway in North Haven. He was a patient, fair and hardworking
          employer – someone who always took the high road, who looked out for contractors and vendors as much as he did
          his
          own employees.<br>
          <br>



          Over time, the company evolved with the needs of the market and its clients, transforming from a wholesale
          distributor to a retail kitchen design firm. Yet Fecke’s founding values never wavered.</i></p>



      Today, those values are the standard that all The Kitchen Company employees are expected to meet, and they live on
      in the company’s value statement:<br><br>
      <ul>
        <li> Honesty to the customer and employees</li><br>

        <li>Ethical behavior</li><br>

        <li>Integrity</li><br>

        <li> Politeness in every situation</li><br>

        <li>Conduct business with manners</li><br>
      </ul>

      “We were able to learn the business from the ground up, alongside some of the most highly regarded professionals
      in the field,” said John Fecke. “It’s our responsibility – and our mission – to maintain The Kitchen Company’s
      reputation as one of the best kitchen design businesses in Connecticut.”
